# SAS custom task example: The Top N Report
***
This repository contains one of a series of examples that accompany
[_Custom Tasks for SAS Enterprise Guide using Microsoft .NET_](https://support.sas.com/pubscat/bookdetails.jsp?pc=61874)
by [Chris Hemedinger](http://support.sas.com/hemedinger).

This particular example goes with
**Chapter 9: The Top N Report**.  It was built using Visual Basic
with Microsoft Visual Studio 2003.  It should run in SAS Enterprise Guide 4.1 and later, as well
as the SAS Add-In for Microsoft Office 2.1 and later.

## About this example
The task example illustrates several techniques and patterns 
that you can apply in your own custom task, including:
* A reusable SAS program that uses SAS macro 
variables to support a variety of scenarios.
* An elegant user interface that reads and displays the 
properties of an input data set, including column names, types, and formats.
* A simple pattern that you can follow for storing user 
selections (called serialization) so that they are remembered 
as part of your SAS Enterprise Guide project.

This example is also featured on [support.sas.com in Sample 33009](http://support.sas.com/kb/33/009.html).
